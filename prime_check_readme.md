prime_check.py contains a function to check if a number is prime, and an additional function that is called by default that provides interactivity. 

Load the program in Python Shell, Idle, or Command Prompt and enter a number of any size, positive or negative, and it will output a bool and a relevant print statement. Or just remove the comment markers from the last 4 lines and comment out lines 42-45 to run large random numbers. Mostly useless, but it's a very fast spin on a classic.
